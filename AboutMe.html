									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>I am a graduate student studying data analytics at Georgia Institute of Technology with an expected graduation date of December 2022.</p>
								</header>
								
								<p><a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/headshot.jpg"  alt="" ALIGN="TOP" HSPACE="50" VSPACE="50"/></a> I have been intrigued by how things work since I was little, with a special interest in processes. 
								As I entered college, I believed that mechanical engineering was the right path for me, but I found 
								I didn't enjoy it as much as I liked managing the projects and interpreting the outcomes of testing. 
								After a pivot in direction, I graduated in 2017 from University of Utah with my Bachelor's degree 
								in Operations Management. Since then, I have worked at places such as Goldman Sachs and Mayo Clinic,
								applying my knowledge to any problem thrown my way. I am now looking for a position in which I can
								continue learning and adding to my skill set, as well as making a positive impact on the world.
								</p>
								<p>One of my favorite projects I have done in the course of my professional career is a Voice of the
								Customer (VOC) analysis of food service (provided by Mayo Clinic Food Services) at Assisi Heights 
								Spirituality Center in Rochester, MN, where the demographic I was surveying were elderly nuns. I designed, 
								administered, collected a survey and quantified the data. I then presented my results and recommended 
								actions to Mayo Clinic Food Services leadership and the residents of Assisi Heights. </p>
								<p>I also had the opportunity to act as LEAN lead for the Legal Entity Management team while I was 
								employed at Goldman Sachs. This entailed not only daily huddles and project management of several 
								process improvement efforts, but also education on what LEAN is and why it can be a game-changing tool 
								in business. </p>
								<p>When I am not working or doing schoolwork, I like to relax with my family. We love to watch movies
								and play games together, and lately our free time has been happily chewed up by our new golden retriever
								puppy. I also enjoy playing violin, reading, and traveling.</p>
