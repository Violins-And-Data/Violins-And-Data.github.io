Books per Month Analysis
  I wanted to increase the number of books I read in a given month using process improvement and data analysis techniques. Given my personal GoodReads data from 2020 and  2021 (a total of 16 months), I did the following:
    1. Process Sigma Calculation
    2. Fishbone Diagram 
    3. Measureability Analysis
    4. Value Stream Mapping of Proposed Solution
    5. Poka Yoke of Potential Solutions
    6. Logistic Regression
