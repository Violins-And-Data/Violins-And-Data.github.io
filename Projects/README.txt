      Simulation of a game with the following conditions:
          Suppose there are two people playing a dice game. They each begin with 4 coins and a pot of 2 coins. Each player also has one six-sided die. For each round of the game both players will roll their dice, which will determine the next action (shown below).

              Roll Value          Action Taken
              1                   Nothing â€“ Player bank and pot stay the same.
              2                   Player takes all coins in the pot. The pot now has 0 coins
              3                   Player takes half the coins in the pot (rounded down). Half remains in pot (rounded up).
              4-6                 Player puts one coin in the pot. Player bank decreases by one and pot increases by one coin.

          The game ends when a player cannot complete an action. We were interested in the expected number of rounds before the game finishes and the distribution of this expected number.
